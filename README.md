CisternMapper
=============

Maps Cisterns in San Francisco using Javascript and MapTiles

The cistern.json files is a GeoJSON file

cisternjson.js returns a JSON object of a number of cisterns. Right now, this is a literal, just added there. Eventually, I'd like this to be a node.js implementation (I think).
